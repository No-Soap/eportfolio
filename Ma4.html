    <h2>Welcome & Overview</h2>
    <p>This ePortfolio represents my learning and growth in ENC 1101. Here, you'll find selected pieces of my writing along with reflections that show how each connects to course outcomes. I hope to demonstrate not only my progress as a writer, but also my engagement with feedback, revision, and rhetorical awareness throughout the semester.</p>

<section id="assignments">
    <h2>Major Assignments</h2>

    <h3>Major Assignment 1</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peer Review Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ou9F1-rSojn4SUC5AOjiYWEfzlILecev/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tLrJTqNvoP_Xywo-Sncz5hK2XssKvyN/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <li><strong>Graded Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/10xnhgi-m6RAefKSXN2ayXonA-DUWYYv2/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <p><em>Reflection:</em>Ma1 is definetly the weakest of all 4, with Ma3 being the strongest. I really improved over these 4 relatively small projects, MA1 is the first stepping stone to that evolution, though I do find it the most interesting of everything I worked on, content wise.</p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Major Assignment 2</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peer Review Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/10DHK9Xhk8G6p7L1bCSYtCEMvMqMJqZUM/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/10DHK9Xhk8G6p7L1bCSYtCEMvMqMJqZUM/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <li><strong>Graded Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mVfutGJAPVfYEM6PEdNOs2HsMz6NZAYZ/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <p><em>Reflection:</em> MA2 while personally not being my favorite, I think objectively its the best written and worded out of the bunch, and I do find it interesting to talk to the social/parasocial relationships that video games can build. </p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Major Assignment 3</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peer Review Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x2ilp-0jWN2p63MjWi3wl0Ta-HdN08vT/view?usp=sharing</li>
        <li><strong>Graded Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mVfutGJAPVfYEM6PEdNOs2HsMz6NZAYZ/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <p><em>Reflection:</em> I feel like I really improved on a lot here. Taking my MA1 and re-writing it was really helpful to becoming a better writer/producer/editor. I feel like I made the content so much more interesting and engaging. I did this by expanding on the ideas I had merely spoken about, and took them above and beyond by showing what the content actually is</p>
    </ul>
