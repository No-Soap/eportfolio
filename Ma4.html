    <h2>Welcome & Overview</h2>
    <p>This ePortfolio represents my learning and growth in ENC 1101. Here, you'll find selected pieces of my writing along with reflections that show how each connects to course outcomes. I hope to demonstrate not only my progress as a writer, but also my engagement with feedback, revision, and rhetorical awareness throughout the semester.</p>

<section id="assignments">
    <h2>Major Assignments</h2>

    <h3>Major Assignment 1</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peer Review Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ou9F1-rSojn4SUC5AOjiYWEfzlILecev/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-tLrJTqNvoP_Xywo-Sncz5hK2XssKvyN/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <li><strong>Graded Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/10xnhgi-m6RAefKSXN2ayXonA-DUWYYv2/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <p><em>Reflection:</em>Ma1 is definetly the weakest of all 4, with Ma3 being the strongest. I really improved over these 4 relatively small projects, MA1 is the first stepping stone to that evolution, though I do find it the most interesting of everything I worked on, content wise.</p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Major Assignment 2</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peer Review Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/10DHK9Xhk8G6p7L1bCSYtCEMvMqMJqZUM/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/10DHK9Xhk8G6p7L1bCSYtCEMvMqMJqZUM/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <li><strong>Graded Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mVfutGJAPVfYEM6PEdNOs2HsMz6NZAYZ/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <p><em>Reflection:</em> MA2 while personally not being my favorite, I think objectively its the best written and worded out of the bunch, and I do find it interesting to talk to the social/parasocial relationships that video games can build. </p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Major Assignment 3</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peer Review Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x2ilp-0jWN2p63MjWi3wl0Ta-HdN08vT/view?usp=sharing</li>
        <li><strong>Graded Draft:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mVfutGJAPVfYEM6PEdNOs2HsMz6NZAYZ/view?usp=drive_link</li>
        <p><em>Reflection:</em> I feel like I really improved on a lot here. Taking my MA1 and re-writing it was really helpful to becoming a better writer/producer/editor. I feel like I made the content so much more interesting and engaging. I did this by expanding on the ideas I had merely spoken about, and took them above and beyond by showing what the content actually is</p>
    </ul>

<section id="additional">
    <h2>Additional Artifacts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Artifact 1:</strong> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dkillz0Alm-qKrVIozH3M8qQHBfhGygT/view?usp=drive_link – Grauman suggests prioritizing
            feedback and breaking revisions into smaller tasks. I plan to apply this by reviewing
            feedback multiple times, focusing on major issues first, and creating a checklist for
            manageable revisions.

    <h2>Outcomes Reflection</h2>
    <p>This section provides a comprehensive reflection connecting my selected artifacts to the course learning outcomes. Here, I discuss my development as a writer, my understanding of audience and purpose, my revision process, and my engagement with feedback. <p>
        Throughout this semester in ENC 1101, I’ve experienced significant growth as a writer, not only in the way I structure and present ideas but also in how I reflect on my process and engage with feedback. This portfolio serves as a map of that journey. From Major Assignment 1 (MA1) to Major Assignment 3 (MA3), and through the additional artifacts, each piece shows how I’ve worked toward achieving the course outcomes, particularly in the areas of rhetorical awareness, process, and critical reflection.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Looking back at <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ou9F1-rSojn4SUC5AOjiYWEfzlILecev/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">Major Assignment 1</a>, I recognize it as my roughest draft in terms of polish, but it was a crucial step in my learning. MA1 laid the groundwork for understanding rhetorical purpose, even if it wasn’t fully refined. I explored interesting content and took risks, which is why I still find it the most compelling topic-wise. It was here that I first experimented with shaping my voice and figuring out how to communicate ideas clearly. Even though I struggled with coherence and clarity, it became a foundation I would revise and rebuild later in MA3.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        MA2 marked a big shift in my development. Though I noted that it wasn't my personal favorite to write, I believe it was my most effective in terms of meeting academic expectations. The topic—parasocial relationships in gaming—allowed me to critically analyze a relevant cultural phenomenon, and I found myself leaning into research and structure more confidently. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mVfutGJAPVfYEM6PEdNOs2HsMz6NZAYZ/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">The final draft</a> was concise, well-argued, and reflected my growing comfort with audience awareness. Peer feedback helped me refine the organization of ideas and pushed me to consider alternative perspectives, improving the depth of the piece overall.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        The most transformative moment came with <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x2ilp-0jWN2p63MjWi3wl0Ta-HdN08vT/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Major Assignment 3</a>, where I took MA1 and essentially rewrote it from the ground up. This revision process was intense but deeply rewarding. I went beyond just editing sentences—I restructured the argument, enriched my content with specific examples, and made the piece more engaging for a broader audience. This shows how my understanding of genre, purpose, and rhetorical situation improved over the semester. As I said in my reflection, "I made the content so much more interesting and engaging"—and that wasn't by accident. I took intentional steps to develop a stronger connection with my audience and deepen my analysis.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Another major takeaway for me was how the writing process isn’t linear. In every major assignment, drafting, feedback, and revision played key roles. The peer reviews helped me see my blind spots, while the feedback drafts allowed me to test ideas in progress and reflect on my decisions. My process evolved from rushing first drafts to actually planning, revisiting, and reflecting between stages. I learned how to let go of things that didn’t work and explore new directions when needed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Looking ahead, the skills I’ve developed in this course will stick with me—not just in other writing classes, but anywhere I need to present ideas clearly and thoughtfully. The ability to revise, reflect, and refine is invaluable. ENC 1101 taught me how to be more intentional, whether I'm choosing evidence, organizing an argument, or shaping a narrative. I feel much more confident in identifying what good writing looks like—and more importantly, how to get there through process.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In short, this portfolio is a snapshot of my learning, but more than that, it’s proof of my growth. Each draft, revision, and reflection connects to the course outcomes in a real way. I’ve improved my rhetorical awareness, learned to trust the process, and become a more thoughtful and flexible writer. And while there’s still room to grow, I’m proud of how far I’ve come. This ePortfolio doesn’t just showcase my best work—it shows my development as a writer who can think critically, engage with ideas, and revise purposefully.
